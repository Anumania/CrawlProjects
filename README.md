IF YOURE TRYING TO MAKE MODS:
  sorry.
  


My collection of crawl mods:

  AtlasImporter: allows you to replace almost every atlas in the game, allowing for retexturing of ui elements or enemies. (Does not allow for ADDING of sprites, only replacing)

  CrawlAPI: an ongoing series of functions and classes designed to allow modders to add content into the game, in a way that allows people to use multiple mods without conflict

  CrawlPrePatcher: a mod used by me for testing.

  DebugMode: a mod used to turn on the debug console upon opening the game. sometimes doesnt work, and is very finnicky with keyboard layouts.

  noPortal: mod that someone requested i make that i never got around to making.
